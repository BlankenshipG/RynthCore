/// One main-thread refresh point for the small per-frame snapshots that the
/// plugin pump (and other engine threads) read instead of touching AC.
///
/// AC's client is single-threaded. The plugin pump ("RynthCore.NormalPluginPump")
/// and the helper threads must not call AC functions or read AC memory that the
/// main thread mutates or frees; they read values sampled here instead. Called
/// from two places that both run on AC's main thread:
///   * GameTickHooks.UseTimeDetour, after AC's own tick and the queue drain. It
///     fires in every mode, before login too.
///   * EngineFrameController.OnEndScene, next to the other prefetches (EndScene
///     is only hooked after login).
/// Each step throttles itself, so running from both is cheap. Nothing here may
/// allocate per call or wait on another thread.
