## Chorizite DatReaderWriter (format reference for the dat readers)

- What: the layout of Asheron's Call .dat files (header, block chains, the directory B-tree) and of the Texture and Palette files, used as the reference when RynthCore's own dat reader and icon decoder were written (2026-10-05). The code is RynthCore's own (MIT); this notice is kept because the library was the format reference.
- Where: `src/RynthCore.StatusAgent/Dat/DatDatabase.cs` and `Dat/IconDecoder.cs`, and `src/RynthCore.Engine/UI/ScriptWindows/AcIconDecoder.cs`. The notice is also in `DatDatabase.cs`'s header. The DXT decoder (`Dat/DxtUtil.cs`) was written from the public S3TC block-compression format.
